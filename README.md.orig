  This is the main branch of development, and serves as a branch for integrating different features for an upcoming release.

Apart from these features there are 4 other kind of branches.

## Feature
  This derives from the development branch and is used to develop features.

## Hotfix
  This derives from the master branch and is used to fix a bug in the production branch that was identified after a release. Every fix made at this branch, must be replied at development branch.
  
## Bugfix
  This derives from the release branch and is used to fix bugs specific to tests.
